        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Yoganandha, a passionate Cyber Security student at Presidency University. I’ve always had a curiosity for technology and how things work behind the scenes. My journey into cybersecurity started with an interest in ethical hacking and computer networks, and it quickly evolved into a deep fascination with the ways we can protect digital systems and sensitive data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and ethical hacking. I believe that learning never stops, and I'm always striving to expand my knowledge to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats. My areas of interest include network security, ethical hacking, cryptography, security protocols, and, most notably, Kali Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am very proficient with Kali Linux, which I regularly use for penetration testing and ethical hacking activities. It's my go-to tool for security auditing, vulnerability analysis, and conducting CTF challenges. Whether it’s using pre-built tools or creating custom scripts, Kali Linux has been an essential part of my learning and project development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I have a strong foundation in programming languages like Python and Java, which I leverage to create security tools and scripts. Additionally, I have worked on several projects related to cybersecurity and IoT, such as my landslide detection system using Raspberry Pi. I also enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals on cybersecurity initiatives and projects, which has broadened my understanding of real-world security challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I enjoy reading about the latest cybersecurity trends, participating in capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and contributing to open-source projects. I also believe in the importance of community, and I’m always open to learning from others and sharing my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, I aim to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to the protection of digital infrastructures, helping organizations safeguard their data from cyberattacks, and making the internet a safer place for everyone.
